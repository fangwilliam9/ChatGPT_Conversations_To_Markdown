 如何之前一直和你讲的，我以前，大概21年及以前也是一个被洗脑的青年中国人，但自从我学会翻墙，倾听了不同的声音之后，我也开始真正认识到民主自由的价值，也开始了追求民主自由的道路。但现在我还在中国大陆生活，一个上大四的学生。但我现在天天都不想去上课，因为我对那些谄媚的老师们的对中共表忠诚的嘴脸极度厌恶，觉得他们都是教计算机科学相关知识的老师，为什么还要和我们扯那些鼓吹习近平的什么新思想。
我每天课也不像去上，每天都在想如何才能润到国外去，每天都在研究澳大利亚的whv或者新西兰的whv，一直幻想着润到国外去。
我刚刚看到了一个奇妙的观点。说是我可能是患上了“政治抑郁症”。

## ChatGPT:

 The user feels disillusioned with their current university education in mainland China, specifically finding it frustrating that their computer science teachers express loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and promote Xi Jinping's ideas. They often think about leaving China, researching working holiday visas (WHV) for Australia and New Zealand, and dream of living abroad. They also encountered the concept of "political depression" and are reflecting on whether they might be experiencing it.

 It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated with the situation you're in, especially when the focus in your classes seems to stray far from the subject matter you're passionate about. The concept of "political depression" refers to the emotional toll that political or societal environments can have on individuals, particularly when they feel powerless or alienated by the system. It sounds like you’re grappling with that sense of disillusionment and longing for a place where you feel more aligned with your values.

The desire to “润” or emigrate is something many people in similar situations consider. Your research into working holiday visas for Australia or New Zealand could be a productive step toward that goal, and it's important to stay focused on finding practical solutions while balancing your current situation. Finding ways to manage the frustration, whether through study, planning, or seeking support from like-minded individuals, might help you navigate this phase.
