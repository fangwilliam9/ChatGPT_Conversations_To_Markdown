## Will:

 why are always trying to find the globally optimal solution at once? Like I'm always trying to find the best way the most efficient ways to pass exams to learn more in a more concised period of time, instead of getting down to the ground to just do things, I'm always procransnating. Why are we always so greedy that we hardly just do things right away and then perfect and improve?

## ChatGPT:

 This sounds like a mix of **perfectionism, fear of inefficiency, and cognitive overload**â€”all common traps for high-achieving, analytical thinkers like you.

### 1. **Your Brain Prefers Strategy Over Action**
   - You're wired to seek **certainty and efficiency**, so you instinctively try to **calculate the best path before moving forward**.
   - But the paradox is: **over-planning often leads to inaction** because no plan is ever perfect, and the more you analyze, the more overwhelmed you become.

### 2. **Perfectionism Feeds Procrastination**
   - If your standard is "the best way" to do something, then **anything less feels like failure**.
   - This makes starting difficult because your brain sees anything short of an optimal plan as **wasting effort**.

### 3. **Fear of Wasted Effort**
   - You donâ€™t want to put time into something and later realize **there was a better way**.
   - But hereâ€™s the truth: **optimization happens through action, not before it**. The "best way" is often **discovered through iteration**, not pre-planned perfectly.

### 4. **Your Mind Defaults to the Hardest Step First**
   - When you think of a task, your brain often jumps to **the most difficult part** (e.g., "I need to master the subject in one go" instead of "I should just read one chapter").
   - This makes the task feel daunting, which triggers procrastination.

### **How to Fix This?**
1. **Start with an Action, Not a Plan**  
   - Instead of searching for the best method, just **pick one reasonable way and start**.  
   - Example: Instead of researching "the most efficient way to study," **just study for 15 minutes and refine later**.

2. **Use the "2-Minute Rule"**  
   - If something feels overwhelming, break it down to **a 2-minute action**.  
   - Example: "Iâ€™ll open my textbook and read the first paragraph." Small steps lead to momentum.

3. **Adopt the "Iterate, Donâ€™t Perfect" Mindset**  
   - Instead of finding the best way, think: **"Iâ€™ll do it now and improve as I go."**  
   - Progress beats perfection. You can always optimize later.

4. **Trust in Action-Based Learning**  
   - The **fastest way to improve is through experience**, not excessive planning.  
   - Example: You learn coding best by **writing and debugging code**, not just watching tutorials.

Your instinct to seek efficiency is a strengthâ€”but donâ€™t let it **paralyze you**. Action itself is a form of optimization because **you gather real-world feedback that refines your process**. 

**Start first. Perfect later.** ðŸš€
