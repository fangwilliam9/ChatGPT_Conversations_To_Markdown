 My father tried to defuse situations
whenever possible. I think that’s why he
stayed in Congress for so long. The guy
could kiss the ugliest babies known to
mankind and still come up with something
nice to say. “He’s such a gentle child,”
he’d say when a baby had a giant head, or,
“I’ll bet she’s the sweetest girl in the
world,” if she had a birthmark over her
entire face. One time a lady showed up
with a kid in a wheelchair. My father took
one look at him and said, “I’ll bet you ten
to one that you’re smartest kid in your
class.” And he was! Yeah, my father was
great at stuff like that. He could fling it
with the best of ’em, that’s for sure. And
he wasn’t such a bad guy, not really,
especially if you consider the fact that he
didn’t beat me or anything.连城一段并准备好，我将问你一些问题
